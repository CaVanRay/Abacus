Abacus will be a piece of software for calculating large numbers.

Right now i'm just working on basic number handling, but I hope to eventually slowly increase the types of calculations as well as automate the process of solving larger and more complicated equations/problems.

basic foundation is finished and working with a factorial calculator.

next step is to get it working with PEMDAS, then more technical functions like square roots? idk, eventually I want to be able to just put in a problem and have a list of all information you can possibly extrapolate out of it pulled up for you.

Skip P for now, but the idea of parenthasis reminds me of something I thought up a long time ago, P-Values for disassembling equations in a program.
